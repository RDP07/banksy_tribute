    <p>Banksy is the most controversial and notorious graffiti artist of all time. He has been in the shadows throughout the world for over 20 years, as his true idenity is still unknown. It is believe that he was born in Bristol, United Kingdom around 1977. Banksy truly pushes the envelope with his street art and makes viewers really question things like: life, government, honest, morality, and humanity. Banksy has become so infamous, when a piece of his is found inhabitants of the area flock to catch a glimpse. Some even try to remove and take pieces, as most of his pieces sold in the art market usally sell for around $500,000.</br></br>Below are a few of my favorite pieces and my interpretations of what they mean to me:</p>

    <p class="jesus-text">Wow! look at this one Jesus hanging from the cross holding presents? This piece clearly identifys the level of materialism humanity has developed. Christmas day was once a holiday for worship for the christians and catholics for the man that "died for their sins". All people care about is "What do you think is in the big present?! Is it for me?!"</p>

    <p>This is one seems all too familiar, except I feel like most of us are thinking there should be grenade in that throwing hand not flowers. This to me is a call to action, make love not war, settle issues with words not violence."</p>
